# 🐶 DoggoSwipe

Welcome! This is my code for my school project: project-tech. During this project I will be making one interaction for the DoggoSwipe app. Feel free to look around or check out my [wiki](https://github.com/samanthavz/project-tech/wiki) for more info! (written in dutch).

# 📃 description and concept

 I am making an interaction for a matching app. The concept is like a tinder for dogs and owners. Dogs that have a hard time finding an owner can be signed up by the dog shelter. The next step is for users to start swiping. When they see a dog they like, they can give them a bone (meaning you will like them). When they don't like a dog, they just swipe away. All the liked dogs will be shown in a list. There you can chat with them (totally realistic, right?) and you will be provided with more contact info. The interaction I will be working on is the "liking" interaction.

 I made this app for **mobile screens and tablets** only. It will work on computers, but it is not aesthetically pleasing. If you want to see it in the best way you can, press ```Shift + CTRL + J``` on windows or ```Option + ⌘ + J```. Then click on the mobile icon (device toolbar) and change the phone size to iphone 6 - iphone X.
